        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a student currently attending <a href="http://bcts.bergen.org">Bergen County Academies</a> and I am really passionate about Computer Science. I have learned a few languages and dabbled in some others, as well as attending quite a few hackathons and making some awesome projects along the way. Also, I really like hardware like Arduino and 3D printing as well!</p>

                    <p>Made as a project for school, this small website helped me to learn how to use a variety of CSS frameworks and further refine my frontend web dev skills. The website explains how one mole of a 24 byte file would take up more than the worlds storage. This was compared to how there were many moles of zinc in a single penny, explaining how small atoms really are.
